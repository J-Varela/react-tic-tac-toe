In this project, i've touched on React concepts including elements, components, props, and state.

I've created a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Let's you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game's history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game's history and see previous versions of a game's board.
